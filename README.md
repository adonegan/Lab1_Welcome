# Lab 1 - Welcome

- Build an ASP.Net MVC application that displays the current system date and time and time zone. 
- The information should be displayed on a new view and this view should be displayed when the application is run. 
- The controller should work out what the current date and time are and pass them into the view as property of ViewBag. 
- Use the existing default controller HomeController to achieve this. 
- The view itself should work out the time zone and display that in addition to the date and time. 

Hint: use DateTime.Now and TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.StandardName. 

- Change the styling, use a red for html heading elements.
